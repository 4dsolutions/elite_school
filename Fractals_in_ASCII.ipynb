    "# Fractals as Unicode Art\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII art was and is a genre, wherein one makes graphical pictures out of lexical components.  The field has since expaned to all of Unicode, although I have yet to see much art labeled as such, while taking advantage of the full range of codepoints available.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of printing ASCII art is it's usually easier to write characters to a text file than pixels to a picture file.  An introduction to the Mandelbrot Set, a paradigm fractal, might confine itself to text file output, in order to focus mainly on the math.  More colorful graphical output could follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tractor in a Field pattern, presented in the Tractors Notebook, sets up our two main players:  the Tractor, and the Field.  The former is the read-write head while the latter is the canvas or paper the read-write head reads from and writes to.  We may use the metaphor of \"plowing\" for writing, although it's really more \"planting\" that we're doing (feel free to take control of the method names in your own future versions)."
