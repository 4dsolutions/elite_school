    "# Coding Through Storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to what some may believe, programmers are not taught to discourage their imaginations, as if the ability to fantisize were a professional liability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, what anchors programming to the real world are what we call \"use cases\" and these are stories we think through and glean from.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even before we start a coding project, we imagine the real world circumstances in which our work is put to some use.  \"How will this app make someone's life better?\" is not a question to ask too late in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also invent short stories to help anchor our understanding of source code.  We need to see the forest, the design pattern, without letting the trees (individual examples) dominate the foreground.  For example, below are our example Supermarket, Shopper and Inventory classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What stories might we weave through here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one:\n",
    "\n",
    "A shopper wanders through a supermarket, pushing a shopping cart, and removing items from the shelves.  The shopper comes in with an electronic wallet, a wifi device, such that pulling an item from the shelf completes a transaction.  If the wallet has become empty or has insufficient funds, just put the item back on the shelf, while making no change to the wallet total.  The shopper may still have enough left in the budget for something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "In eyeballing the code, we find the logic of try / except / else / finally corresponds to the story.  We may choose to add more detail.  We may express our story in the form of a simulation, or workout, or rehearsal, of the script."
