    "\"Algorithms\" are named for a Persian polymath who worked out of the Wisdom School in Baghdad (Iraq had not yet been invented as a country).  \n",
    " \n",
    "His name in Persian is: محمد بن موسی خوارزمی, which gets Latinized as Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (c. 780 – c. 850), or Al Khwarizmi for short, which sounds a little bit like \"Al Gorithm\" (not not a lot).  \"Algorithm\" sounds a lot more like \"Al Gore\" (that's a joke, why?  See notes below).\n",

    "![\"al Khwarizmi\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Khwarizmi_Amirkabir_University_of_Technology.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is an \"algorithm\" anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a step-by-step numerical recipe, something to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of \"numerical recipes\" as at the basis of  arithmetic and is what we learn in school as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of \"numerical recipes\" spread to Italy, through the town of Pisa where the famous Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170 - c. 1250) wrote *Liber Abaci*, based on Al Khwarizmi's work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you learned Arabic numerals, Fibonacci told his readers, you could get free of Roman numerals and the abacus.  You could learn to compute on paper or on a chalkboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking \"if algorithm means step-by-step number crunching then isn't any computer program an algorithm?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty close to how people use the word nowadays.  People talk about the \"recommendation algorithm\" used by online sellers to suggest other, related products you might want ot buy."
