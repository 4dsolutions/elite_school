    "The essentials of RSA were first discovered by cryptographers working for GHCQ, a UK institution.  The algorithm was kept secret for fear of aiding some generic enemy.  Unleashing it upon the world could have unforeseen consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIT mathematicians who developed the RSA algorithm were not beholden to GHCQ and resisted the NSA's efforts to keep a lid on it.  The web was emerging and businesses needed to offer a secure way to encrypt transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pubic key cryptography had come of age."
