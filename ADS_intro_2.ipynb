    "# Choosing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "You know from your own experience that some ways of accomplishing a task may take a lot longer than others.  Going more slowly may have its advantages, as in real life we're accomplishing multiple tasks and have to weigh trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could wolf your dinner in a hurry, and if the only objective were to eat and run, this could be appropriate.  However dinner may be an important social occasion and eating quickly and leaving the table only deprives one of catching up on important developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first question, when faced with a computing challenge, is whether there's a solution at all.  The second question is whether this solution is at all practical in terms of time and resources.  A third question is how much original work will be required on your part, and how long might that take.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question involves research and not reinventing the wheel.  If people stopped to reinvent every algorithm from scratch, we would move forward much too slowly.  Everyone would need the same insights and genius as everyone else we we know the world is not like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, simply grabbing a published algorithm from a book without having much insight into how the algorithm actually works, or why, may lead to troubles down the road.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not really understanding how an algorithm works should not prevent you from using it though.  In computing, we learn to treat some elements of our system as \"black boxes\" meaning we have no insight into the internals, but may use them anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question (how long?) involves understanding what's called \"Big O notation\" which looks something like $O(n^{2})$ or $O(n\\ log(n))$.  Big O notation is about roughly how long an algorithm will likely take to find a solution, and is pegged to some input \"n\" of growing dimension.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, n might be the number of digits in a number, and you want to know if the number is prime, or its prime factors.  Many off-the-self algorithms address these very questions."
