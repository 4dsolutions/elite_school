    "Building mathematical knowledge up to where RSA (named for inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman) makes sense, gives you many useful concepts and insights along the way.\n",

    "All positive integers [except 1](https://www.quora.com/Is-1-a-composite-number?share=1) are either composite or prime.  Mathematician J. H. Conway suggested we make -1 a prime, as then negative integers could also be reduced to prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovering whether a giant integer is composite or prime is not always easy, because huge composites with only two prime factors may behave just like primes, and finding these factors can be really hard to do.  Absent any factorization, the number might be prime after all, right?\n",

    "In fact, RSA depends on factoring large composites being next to impossible, if they're large enough."
