    "\n",
    "The contemporary term \"algorithm\" derives from the proper name of a Persian polymath who worked out of the Wisdom School in Baghdad over a thousand years ago. Iraq had not yet been invented as a country back then.\n",
    " \n",
    "His name in Persian was: محمد بن موسی خوارزمی, which gets Latinized as Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (c. 780 – c. 850), or Al Khwarizmi for short, which sounds a little bit like \"Al Gorithm\" (but not a lot).  \"Algorithm\" sounds a lot more like \"Al Gore\" (a joke, why?  See note [1] below).\n",

    "\n",
    "But what is an \"algorithm\" anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a step-by-step numerical recipe, something to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of \"numerical recipes\" is at the basis of  arithmetic and is what we learn in school as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When school teachers talk about elementary school math, they talk about teaching algorithms, such as how to perform long division, or how to find a square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of \"numerical recipes\" spread to the Italian peninsula and to the rest of Europe, through the Republic of Pisa, where the famous Leonardo Fibonacci (c. 1170 - c. 1250) wrote *Liber Abaci*, based on Al Khwarizmi's work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you learned to use Arabic numerals, Fibonacci told his readers, you could get free of relatively clunky Roman numbers and the abacus.  You could learn to compute on paper or on a chalkboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking \"if algorithm means step-by-step number crunching then isn't any computer program an algorithm?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty close to how people use the word nowadays.  People talk about the \"recommendation algorithm\" used by online sellers to suggest other, related products you might want ot buy."
