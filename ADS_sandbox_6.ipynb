    "* Q: Is a polyhedron a graph? <br />A: Yes, by some definitions.\n",

    "  A: I'm so glad you asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "What computer scientists often talk about, in connection with Graph Theory, are road and rail networks.  Roads come together at intersections, which are sometimes traffic circles.  Rail roads have switches and round houses, allowing trains to access all the connected tracks, even if they must reverse direction to do so sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thinking about road and rail, we also think about direction.  A directed graph tells us in which direction a road runs, perhaps in both, perhaps not. Ditto with railways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps a route is one way north to south for some hours, and south to north at other hours.  Freeways with extra express lanes may change their directionality to coincide with rush hour requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final factor we will consider is \"weight\" which can mean a lot of things, such as distance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However \"weight\" may fold in many more measurements than simply \"time between nodes\" at a certain speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the \"weightiness\" of a Route:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How twisty is this road? \n",
    "* Do wild animals suddenly appear in the headlights?\n",
    "* What about the number of lanes?  \n",
    "* How stressful is this road to drive?  \n",
    "* Does this road have any gas stops or other facilities?\n",
    "* Does this road feature steep drop offs with no guard rails?  \n",
    "\n",
    "One might imagine a long checklist of criteria, adding up to what we would call a segment's score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a score associated with each edge, we're ready to apply such algorithm's as Djikstra's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Djikstra's Algorithm is about minizine the total weight between any starting node, and every other node in the network."
