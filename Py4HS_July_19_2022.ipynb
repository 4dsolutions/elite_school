    "### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we introduced (again) the built-in collection types, such as the dictionary, list and even string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric Types\n",
    "    * int     -- the integer, any number of digits\n",
    "    * float   -- numbers with decimal points, 128 bits\n",
    "    * Decimal -- like floats, but open ended precision\n",
    "    * Fraction -- like the Rat we've been coding\n",
    "- String Type\n",
    "    * str -- all of Unicode (alphabets, Chinese, emoji)\n",
    "- Collection Types\n",
    "    * list -- left to right sequence\n",
    "    * tuple -- less mutable list (sequence)\n",
    "    * str -- also a collection (sequenc)\n",
    "    * range -- similar to a list of integers (sequence)\n",
    "    * dict -- key:value pairs  (mapping)\n",
    "    * set -- keys with no duplicates (mapping)\n",
    "    \n",

    "### Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an \"adjacency matrix\" records how rooms interconnect via doors, or underground chambers by means of tunnels, or towns by means of roads. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics do not matter much at this level.  In every case we're thinking about a network or graph.  A graph is defined in terms of edges and nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are the places were edges come together, as in a railway system, where nodes are the stations and terminals, and the edges are the rail lines (the tracks) between them."
