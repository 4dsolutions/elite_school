    "    * int     -- the integer, any number of digits\n",

    "    * complex -- real and imaginary parts (not ordered)\n",
    "    * Decimal -- like floats, but open ended precision\n",
    "    * Fraction -- like the Rat we've been coding\n",
    "- String Type\n",
    "    * str -- all of Unicode (alphabets, Chinese, emoji)\n",
    "- Collection Types\n",
