    "### XYZ Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a big part of high school mathematics is becoming familiar with what we call Cartesian Coordinates, named for Rene Descartes, considered one of the great philosophers (\"I think therefore I am\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using three numbers to determine a fixed point in space, relative to \"coordinate axes\" is often tackled twice:  first without the vector concept, then with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this curriculum, focused as it is on \"math objects\", it makes sense to just start with [the Vector type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) right from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of this curriculum is the optional use of a raytracer, POV-Ray in particular, to render scenes with geometric content in the foreground, and perhaps a blue sky with clouds in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raytracer connects us to art history, and the invention of perspective. Depending on the course and teacher experience, a foray into Renaissance master works (often done by a team) is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in the repo is [pov.py](pov.py), a Python module that writes Scene Description Language in output files, suitable for feeding to POV-Ray.  Pov-Ray is a time-tested cross platform free open source engine, with both command line and GUI front ends.\n",

    "![XYZ Vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/3D_Vector.svg/254px-3D_Vector.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Attribution](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Vector.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical idea of an XYZ Vector is too abstract to include attributes such as color, let alone \"thickness\".  However on a mathematical canvas, with the physics of light (electromagnetism) involved, color and thickness come into their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an object oriented language such as Python, we have the option to define a Vector type as purely mathematical, with a POV_Vector subclass that's specialized to communicate with POV-Ray, wherein real world \"secondary attributes\" such as thickness and color make sense to the viewer."
