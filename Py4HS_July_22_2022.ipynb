    "Usually a big part of high school mathematics is becoming familiar with what we call Cartesian Coordinates, named for Rene Descartes, considered one of the great philosophers (\"I think therefore I am\").  The idea of using three numbers to determine a fixed point in space, relative to \"coordinate axes\" is often tackled twice:  first without the vector concept, then with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this curriculum, focused as it is on \"math objects\", it makes sense to just start with the Vector type right from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of this curriculum is the optional use of a raytracer, POV-Ray in particular, to render scenes with geometric content in the foreground, and perhaps a blue sky with clouds in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in the repo is [pov.py](pov.py), a Python module that writes Scene Description Language in output files, suitable for feeding to POV-Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical idea of a Vector is too abstract to include attributes such as color, let alone \"thickness\".  In an object oriented language such as Python, we have the option to define a Vector type as mathematical, with a POV_Vector subclass that's specialized to communicate with POV-Ray."
