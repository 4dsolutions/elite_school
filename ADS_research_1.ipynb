    "Beginning with exactly this list of 5-letter words, we embarked upon some research adventures bringing in our sense of Graph Theory.  The words are nodes and we consider them connected by an edge if they are one and only one letter different.\n",

    "For example, neighbors of \"caked\" would be \"naked\" and \"baked\".  We will need an algorithm that gives us a complete list of neighbors.\n",

    "* given \"only one letter different\" defines an edge between words, does our net of connected words encompass all the words?\n",

    "* if the answer to the above question is \"no\" then does the set consist of \"islands\" of words with definite boundaries?\n",
