    "### Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions have the potential to become an entertaining passtime, if not a full-fledged hobby.  Python's implementation may not be the very best (in the sense of complete) out there, but it's certainly world class.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; sometimes referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation. Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. \n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Regexes were not featured as a part of the relic high school *mathematics* textbooks we've considered.  However they may have been included in an optional [computer science track](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in those days, computer science (compsci) and mathematics were kept apart at the high school level, to a degree we might today find dumbfounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expression syntax was actually invented by Stephen Cole Kleene, [a mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene), who was in turn a student of [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) of [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) ($\\lambda$ calc) fame."
