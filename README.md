# elite_school

Jupyter Notebooks and source code originally developed for a 
synchronous online course offered in Greater Portland, in 2021.

Students were encouraged to create their own Github accounts,
and also to clone this one locally, and to pull down updates.
Students were also invited to fork the school text and continue
it in some direction of their own choosing.

The course doubled as a deeper dive into Python, for those 
already with some experience.  These were high school students,
and younger, but with lots of backgrounding in coding already,
including in other languages.  I covered a lot of the same 
topics I would cover with adults for other companies.
