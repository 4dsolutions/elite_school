    "# Python for High School:  Making Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of \"types\" is less a matter of computer science or mathematics, and more a matter of ordinary language, wherein we learn to group things by their type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screwdriver is a type of tool.  A car is a type of motorvehicle.  A motorvehicle is a type of vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I say \"Sheila is a type of animal\" then the game might be to guess which one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is Sheila a dog, cat, octopus or parrot?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which \"type\" (or \"species\") of animal Sheila is, we might expect certain capabilities, behaviors, attributes.  If Sheila is a giraffe, we would expect she has a long neck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have presumably learned to typify objects ever since they started thinking, whenever that was (a matter of ongoing research).  Identifying the type of something, say a plant, is a core survival skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which plants are safe to eat?  We know by recognizing their type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type-Oriented Computer Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oriented\" means \"pointing in that direction\" or \"especially fit for that use\".  Python is both type oriented and object oriented.  We think in terms of objects, each of a specific type or types (an object may be of more than one type in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python and other similar computer languages (such as Java), we're free to set up a kind of \"type scheme\" like an \"ecosystem\" of several animals, in a mix with other objects.  Perhaps a \"jungle\" would be a good word, in terms of variety and propensity to grow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This jungle is designed to get work done in some way.  The surrounding Notebook is perhaps our guide book, explaining what's here and what it does.\n",
